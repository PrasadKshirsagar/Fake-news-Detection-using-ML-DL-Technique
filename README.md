This repository contains all the datasets, ML models, DL models along with all the necessary codes used for the work.

About Datasets :

We worked on 6 datasets. These are as follows :
1) ISOT Dataset
2) Kaggle Dataset
3) BSdetector Dataset
4) Fakenewsnet Dataset
5) Liar Dataset
6) Buzzfeed-Webis Dataset

These datasets are available in the datasets folder. Each dataset was Stratified partioned in train:validation:test in the ratio 70:10:20. Out of all 6 datasets, We took 70% of each dataset (i.e. all training files) and combined them all to make a training set (represented by train_total.csv). 10 % of each dataset (i.e. all validation files) were combined to make a validation set (represented by val_total.csv). Testing accuracy of the resultant model was tested on respective test files of each dataset.

About Models :

We applied 5 Deep Learning models and 4 Machine Learning models on the above data. Saved models and their codes are in the models folder. These models are as follows :

1) Text CNN
2) Text RNN
3) Text RCNN
4) Hierarchical Attention Network
5) Seq2Seq Model
6) Decision Tree
7) Random Forest
8) Support Vector Machine
9) Naive Bayes
